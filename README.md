# STM32 Closed-Loop DC Motor Control

This project implements a closed-loop DC motor speed control system using STM32F103.

## Features
- PI speed controller (1 ms ISR)
- PWM-based motor drive
- Speed and current feedback (Simulink data)
- Stall detection with time-based logic
- Fault latching and safe shutdown

## Tools Used
- STM32CubeIDE
- MATLAB / Simulink
- ARM Cortex-M3 (STM32F103)

## Project Phases
- Phase 3: STM32 firmware architecture
- Phase 4: Simulink co-simulation (CSV data)
- Phase 5: Fault injection
- Phase 6: Stall detection

## Author
Engineering Final Year Project
